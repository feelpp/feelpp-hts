We took this example from : [[Zermeno]] _A self-consistent model for estimating the critical current of superconducting devices_, V Zermeño et al 2015 Supercond. Sci. Technol. 28 085004, https://www.htsmodelling.com/?page_id=748#Ps_model[Link] .

== Description
stem:[\quad]In this example, we will build self consistent algorithm in order to estimate the critical current with a magnetic model on coil geometry surrounded by air in axisymmetric coordinates. We will use the *A Formulation* and *Gauge Condition*.
Thus stem:[\Omega] the domain contains the superconductor domain stem:[\Omega_c] and non conducting materials stem:[\Omega_c^C] (stem:[\mathbf{J} = 0]) like the air for example. Also stem:[\Gamma = \partial \Omega] is the bound of stem:[\Omega], stem:[\Gamma_c = \partial \Omega_c] the bound of stem:[\Omega_c], stem:[\Gamma_D] the bound with Dirichlet boundary condition and stem:[\Gamma_N] the bound with Neumann boundary condition, such that stem:[\Gamma = \Gamma_D \cup \Gamma_N].

We introduce : 

* Magnetic potential field stem:[\mathbf{A}] : stem:[\textbf{B} = \nabla \times \textbf{A}]

=== Equation 

For this example, we will use the E-J power law to rewrite the stem:[J] expression :

[stem]
++++
J=\frac{J_c(B)}{E_c}\left|\frac{E}{E_c}\right|^{(1-n)/n} E=J_c(B) P
++++
where :
[stem]
++++
P=\frac{E}{E_c}\left|\frac{E}{E_c}\right|^{(1-n)/n}
++++

When the current density reaches stem:[I_c] i.e stem:[J=J_c(B)], then stem:[E=E_c] and stem:[P=1]. For bundles of conductors carrying the same current, we have on constant stem:[P_i|i\in\{1,2,...n_c\}] for each conductor. To impose a current stem:[I_a] in the stem:[i]th conductor, we need to choose stem:[P_i] as :

[stem]
++++
I_a=\int_{\Omega_i} P_i J_c(B) dxdy
++++

where stem:[\Omega_i] is the domain of the stem:[i]th conductor. As stem:[P_i] is constant, it can be calculated as :

[stem]
++++
P_i=I_a/\int_{\Omega_i} J_C(B) dxdy
++++

FInally the  A-Formulation in 2D coordinates is :

[example,caption="",title="A Formulation in 2D coordinates"]
====
[stem]
++++
- \begin{matrix}
    -\frac{1}{\mu}\Delta A  + \frac{1}{\mu r^2}A   =  J_c(B) P & \text{on } \Omega & \text{(A 2D)} \\
\end{matrix} 
++++

With : 

* stem:[A] : potential magnetic field

* stem:[J_c(B)] : critical current density using the Kim's law : stem:[J_c(B)=J_{c0}/\left(1+\sqrt{\frac{(k\partial_y A)^2+(-\partial_x A)^2)}{B_c}}\right)^b]

* stem:[P] : rewritten power law :
stem:[P=\frac{E}{E_c}\left|\frac{E}{E_c}\right|^{(1-n)/n}]

* stem:[\mu] : electric permeability stem:[kg/A^2/S^2]
====

=== Self-consistent Algorithm

In order to have find the critical current, we need to have criteria to stop the algorithm and find stem:[I_c]. For the case of transport current in Roebel coil with a axisymmetric model, we implemented :

* The MAX criterion is when _at least one conductor_ has its voltage drop per unit length stem:[E_i] reach its critical value stem:[E_c], i.e stem:[P_i=1]. The condition is stem:[\max_{i\in\{1,2,...,n_c\}}P_i=1]. 

* The MAX-AVG criterion is when the average voltage drop per unit length stem:[E_i] has reached its critical value stem:[E_c] in _at least one turn_. The condition is stem:[\max_{j\in \{1,..,m\}}\sum^{k}_{i=1}P_{i,j}|P_{i,j}|^{n-1}=k] for a coil composed of stem:[m] turns made of stem:[k] conductors.

* The SUM-AVG criterion is when the _sum of the average voltage drop_ in each turn, divide by the coil's length, has reached its critical value stem:[E_c] in _at least one turn_. The condition is stem:[\sum^{m}_{j=1}\sum^{k}_{i=1}P_{i,j}|P_{i,j}|^{n-1} l_j=L_k] for a coil composed of stem:[m] turns made of stem:[k] conductors, stem:[l_j] the length of the _j_th turn of the coil and stem:[L_k] the total lenght of the coil.

----
<1> the field name of the toolbox to which the post-processing is associated
<2> the `Exports` identifies the toolbox fields that have to be exported for visualisation
<3> the list of fields to be exported
<4> the list of expressions assiocated to the fields to be exported
<5> `B` is for the magnetic flux density
<6> `J_z` is for the current density
<7> the physical entity (associated to the mesh) to which the expression is applied
<8> the `Measure` identifies the quantities tht will be computed after the solve. The values computed are stored in a CSV files.
<9> the name associated with the Statistics computation
<10> the Statistics type
<11> the mesh marker where the Statistics is computed. This entry can be a vector of marker
<12> index that wil replace %1%
<13> storing the field for the next iteration of the algorithm
<14> the names of fields that we want to save (can be a name or a vector of name)
<15> the format used ("hdf5")

=== CFG file

The Model CFG (`.cfg`) files allow to pass command line options to {feelpp} applications. In particular, it allows to  define the solution strategy and configure the linear/non-linear algebraic solvers.

The Cfg file used is
----
directory=feelpp-hts/Roebel_Cables/cfpdes_axis<1>

case.dimension=2<2>

[cfpdes]<3>
filename=$cfgdir/Roebel_coil.json<4>

verbose_solvertimer=1<5>
solver=Picard-OLD<6>

snes-monitor=1<7>
ksp-monitor=1<8>
snes-maxit=600<9>

----
<1> the directory where the results are exported
<2>	the dimension of the application, by default 3D
<3> toolbox prefix
<4> the associated Json file
<5> information on solver time
<6> the non-linear solver
<7> snes-monitor
<8> ksp-monitor
<9> maximum number of iteration
